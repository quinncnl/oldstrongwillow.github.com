title: Willowyard Trading Strategy
---

I started a new trading strategy on 03/13/2014.

This strategy uses short stop-loss and large take-profit. It is manual, trend following and based on fundamentals. My goal is to double it in six month.

Trading elements include forex, gold and Indices, but mainly gold and Indices.
