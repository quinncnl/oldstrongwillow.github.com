Yesterday, Bank of Cananda announced its monetory policy. While the central bank left interest rates unchanged at 1%, they have grown more concerned about low inflation. As a consequence, USDCAD soared more than 150 pips.

Several months ago, I found a Indian trader's trading history and stats. He did really well and managed to achieve a profitability rate of 41% in just two month. However, when I checked his open orders yesterday, I found something interesting. While his balance is about $1000, he opened more than 1 lot of short positions on USDCAD, right before BoC's announcement, and without a proper stoploss! That's totally not acceptable because this is downright gambling on the news.

When the news released and USDCAD soared, he continued to sell this pair like haunted! After some time, unfortunately, his $1000 account lost more than 90% in just one night, with a balance of only $80 now. What's funny to me is that he is still selling on USDCAD, but only 0.02 lot now.

This is a good lesson if you just started forex trading.
