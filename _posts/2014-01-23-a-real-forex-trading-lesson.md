Yesterday, Bank of Cananda announced its monetory policy. While the central bank left interest rates unchanged at 1%, they have grown more concerned about low inflation. As a consequence, USDCAD soared more than 150 pips.

Several months ago, I discovered a guy's trading history and stats. The guy did really well. He managed to achieve a profitability rate of 41% in just two month. However, when I checked his open orders yesterday, I found something interesting. He opened more than 1 lot of short positions on USDCAD, before BoC's announcement, and without proper SL! That's totally not acceptable because this is downright gambling on the news. I made several such mistakes and I will not ever risk that again.

When the news released and USDCAD soared, he just continued to sell like haunted! Then terribles things happend, his 1000USD account lost in just one night, he had 80USD now. What's funny is that he is still selling on USDCAD, but only 0.02 lot now.

This is a good lesson if you just started forex trading.
